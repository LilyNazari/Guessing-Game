Wordle Game in Streamlit
This is a simple implementation of a Wordle Game using Streamlit. The goal of the game is to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined list within a given time limit and number of attempts.

Features
Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from the Brown corpus with a word length between 3 to 6 letters.
Difficulty Levels: Choose from three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that affect the time limit and scoring.
Time and Attempts: Players have a limited number of attempts and time based on the difficulty mode and the word length.
Guess Evaluation: Displays common letters between the guess and the correct answer.
Game History: Game data, including scores and attempts, is saved in a game_history.json file.
Stats Dashboard: Displays statistics such as winning rate, best score, and average score, as well as a bar chart of scores and a line chart of attempts.


Stats
The stats page displays:
Winning Rate: The percentage of games won.
Best Score: The highest score achieved in a game.
Average Score: The average score of all games played.
Scores: A bar chart showing scores for each game.
Attempts: A line chart displaying the number of attempts for each game.


How to Play
The game presents a word with a specific length, and the player needs to guess the word within the allowed attempts and time limit.
Players enter their guesses in an input box and can receive feedback on whether their guess contains any common letters with the correct word.
After guessing, the score is calculated based on the difficulty mode, and the game progresses until the player either guesses correctly or runs out of attempts or time.


Settings
Difficulty Mode: Choose between easy, medium, or hard, which affects the time and score calculation.
Theme: Toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode for the app's interface.


Game Flow
Start Game: A new game can be started by clicking the "New Game" button, resetting the game state and session.
Timer: The remaining time is displayed on the screen, counting down until it hits zero or the player guesses the correct word.
Game Over: If the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts, the game ends and is recorded in the game history.


Setup
Example UI:
Game Tab: Where you play the game by guessing the word and see the real-time score and remaining time.
Stats Tab: View your winning rate, best score, average score, and attempt data visualized in charts.
Settings Tab: Customize the difficulty mode and theme (light/dark).
Save and Load History
Game results (scores, attempts, and whether the game was won) are stored in a game_history.json file.
History is loaded at the start of the game, and new results are appended to this file after each game.
